## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** are:

- A convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
  procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**x64 Windows**, **x64 macOS**, **arm64 macOS**, **x64 GNU/Linux**, **arm64 GNU/Linux**).
- Multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system.
- No need to worry about dependent libraries, they are all included.
- Not affected by system updates that
  might change the versions of the dependent libraries.
- Significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric.
- Projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.
